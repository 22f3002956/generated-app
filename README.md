# Hello IIT Madras Web App

This is a simple web application that displays a message and allows the user to change the background color by clicking a button.

## Files Included
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- `app.js`: JavaScript file that includes functionality for changing the background color.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the webpage.

## How It Works
1. **HTML Structure**: The `index.html` file contains a heading displaying "Hello IIT Madras" and a button to change the background color.
2. **JavaScript Functionality**: The `app.js` file contains an event listener for the button. When clicked, it generates a random hex color using the `getRandomColor` function and applies it as the body's background color.
3. **Styling**: The `style.css` file styles the page, including centering the text and adding some effects to the button.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser.
3. Click the button to see the background color change!
